this google talk client copies the following code:
function tlsInit(); is based heavily on the tls handshake method example given in the MP1 spec. It is mostly a copy of that example, with certain things removed. 

the client() ad client_authenticate() functions are copied mostly from the example given for gsasl authentication. 

the select() loop is partially based off of
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/select_tut.2.html
but it is heavily modified



the helper functios for the roster and send receive functions were developed as they were needed
 
also, helper functions for standard string sending and tls string sending were implemented for convienience. 



I implemented all requested functions for this MP
